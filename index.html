<h3>Hello! My name is Joe, and I'm an education reporter based in Southern California. </h3>
<p>I currently cover three public school districts and one community college at <a class="bodyLinks" href="http://www.desertsun.com/staff/10061326/joseph-hong/"> <i>The Desert Sun</i></a>, a daily newspaper in Palm Springs, CA.</p>
<p>I've written across the ed beat at federal, state and local levels, but my first commitment has always been to cultivating relationships with sources. I'm a stickler for attending board meetings, parent events and high school football games to get the stories that the data might miss.</p>
<p>I've used data throughout my career, but I'm currently working to expand my technical skill set. In July 2019, I attended The Data Institute in New York City, a two-week training in data journalism taught by reporters at ProPublica.</p>
