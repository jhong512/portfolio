<h3>Hello! My name is Joe, and I'm an education reporter based in Southern California. </h3>
<p class="caravan"><img class="schoolbus" src="schoolbus.png"><img class="schoolbus" src="schoolbus.png"><img class="schoolbus" src="schoolbus.png"></p>
<p>I currently cover three public school districts (83 schools) and one community college in the Coachella Valley for <a class="bodyLinks" href="http://www.desertsun.com/staff/10061326/joseph-hong/" target="_blank"><i>The Desert Sun</i></a>, a daily newspaper in Palm Springs, CA.</p>
<img src="CVSchools.jpg">
<p>I take a watchdog and investigative approach to the beat. I file routine requests for public records, and I make an effort to present readers with clear and precise data.</p>
<p>But my first commitment is to cultivating relationships with sources. I'm a stickler for attending school board meetings, PTA meetings and high school football games.</p>
<p>After earning an M.S. in journalism from Columbia University in 2017, I worked at a magazine called <a class="bodyLinks" href=https://diverseeducation.com/article/author/jhong/ target='_blank'><i>Diverse: Issues in Higher Education</i></a> covering equity issues until moving to <i>The Desert Sun</i> in 2018.</p>
<p>Before journalism, I was a PhD student in comparative literature at Rutgers University, specializing in theories of education during the Protestant Reformation. I left before finishing, and my parents never let it go.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy playing tennis, fermenting foods and beverages and camping. I also co-host a <a class="bodyLinks" href=https://www.kcodcoachellafm.com/mfe.html target='_blank'>radio show</a> at a local community college.</p>
